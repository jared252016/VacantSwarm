# VacantSwarm

Thought Board

OpenZFS on ARM + Deduplication w/ Memory through Docker for miminal footprint with a lot of small (16MB containers)

Unsure if ARM will work with it... Docker has the functionality on ZFS and a few other file systems to share memory among containers for .so modules and the like. Should be able to achieve 16MB each and fill a typical home network with ~4GB of RAM for the swarm + 2GB for the honeypot + Router.

Countermeasures

Virus detected... launch a swarm of IP addresses in vacant slots. Having ports open that forward back to a honeypot.
